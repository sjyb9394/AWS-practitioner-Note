    -	AWS Cloud Best Practices – Design Principles
        o	Scalability : vertical & horizontal
        o	Disposable Resources: servers should be disposable & easily configured
        o	Automation: Serverless, Infrastructure as a Service, Auto Scaling
        o	Loose Coupling:
            •	Monolith are applications that do more and more over time, become bigger
            •	Break it down into smaller, loosely coupled components
            •	A change or failure in one component should not cascade to other components
        o	Services, not Servers:
            •	Don’t ust just EC2
            •	Use managed services, databases, serverless, etc.

        o	1) Operational Excellence
        o	2) Security
        o	3) Reliability
        o	4) Performance Efficiency
        o	5) Cost Optimization
        o	They are not something to balance, or trade-offs, they’re a synergy.

    1st Pillar: Operational Excellence
        -	Includes the ability to run and monitor systems to deliver business value and to continually improve supporting processes and procedures
        -	Design Principles:
            o	Perform operations as code – Infrastructure as code (CloudFormation)
            o	Annotate documentation – Automate the creation of annotated documentation after every build.
            o	Make frequent, small, reversible changes – So that in case of any failure, you can reverse it.
            o	Refine operations procedures frequently – And ensure that team members are familiar with it.
            o	Anticipate failure
            o	Learn from all operational failures
        -	AWS Services
            o	Prepare – CloudFormation, Config
            o	Operate – CloudFormation, Config, CloudTrail, CloudWatch, X-Ray
            o	Evolve – CloudFormation, CodeBuild, CodeCommit, CodeDeploy, CodePipeline

    2nd Pillar: Security
        -	Includes the ability to protect information, systems, and assets while delivering business value through risk assessments and mitigation strategies.
        -	Design Principles:
            o	Implement a strong identity foundation – Centralize privilege management and reduce (or even eliminate) reliance on long-term credentials – Principle of least privilege – IAM
            o	Enable traceability – Integrate logs and metrics with systems to automatically respond and take action
            o	Apply security at all layers – Like edge network, VPC, subnet, load balancer, every instance, operating system, and application
            o	Automate security best practices
            o	Proect data in transit and at rest – Encryption, tokenization, and access control
            o	Keep people away from data – Reduce or eliminate the need for direct access or manual processing of data.
            o	Prepare for security events – Rund incident reponse simulations and use tools with automation to increase your speed for detection, investigation, and recovery.
        -	AWS Services
            o	Identity and Access Management – IAM, AWS-STS, MFA token, AWS Organizations

    3rd Pillar: Reliability 
        -	Ability of a system to recover from infrastructure or service disruptions, dynamically acquire computing resources to meet demand, and mitigate disruptions such as misconfigurations or transient network issues
        -	Design Principles
            o	Test recovery procedures – Use automation to simulate different failures or to recreate scenarios that led to failures before
            o	Automatically recover from failure – Anticipate and remediate failures before they occur 
            o	Scale horizontally to increase aggregate system availability – Distribute requests across multiple, smaller resources to ensure that they don’t share a common point of failure
            o	Stop guessing capacity – Maintain the optimal level to satisfy demand without over or under provisioning – Use auto scaling
            o	Manage change in automation – Use automation to make changes to infrastructure
        -	AWS Services
            o	Foundations – IAM, VPC, Service Limits, Trusted Advisor

    4th Pillar: Performance Efficiency
        -	Includes the ability to use computing resources efficiently to meet system requirements, and to maintain that efficiency as demand changes and technologies evolve
        -	Design Principles
            o	Democratize advanced technologies – Advance technologies become services and hence you can focus more on product development
            o	Go global in minutes – Easy deployment in multiple regions
            o	Use serverless architectures – Avoid burden of managing servers
            o	Experiment more often – Easy to carry out comparative testing
            o	Mechanical sympathy – Be aware of all AWS services
        -	AWS Services

    5th Pillar: Cost Optimization
        -	Includes the ability to run systems to deliver business value at the lowest price point
        -	Design Principles
            o	Adopt a consumption mode – Pay only for what you use
            o	Measure overall efficiency – Use CloudWatch
            o	Stop spending money on data center operations – AWS does the infrastructure part and enables customer to focus on organization projects
            o	Analyze and attribute expenditure – Accurate identification of system usage and costs, helps measure return on investment (ROI) – Make sure to use tags
            o	Use managed and application level services to reduce cost of ownership – As managed services operate at cloud scale, they can offer a lower cost per transaction or service
